## Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
### Project Overview
---
The Retail store seeks to analyse the comprehensive analysis of its sales performance across a defined period to gain valuable insights into customer preferences, product sales and regional performances.






### Project Recap
### Problem
---
In this project, I was tasked with;
1. Analyzing the sales performance of a retail store and
2. To explore sales data to uncover key insights such as:
     i. Top-selling products,
    ii. Regional performance, and
   iii. Monthly sales trends
   
### Process
---
So, how did I tackle this problem?
Well I approached it in 5 steps:
1. Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand 
the data in detail. So I took the time to understand the data model and 
domain of the business.
2. Data cleaning - after understanding your business, I then cleaned the 
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for 
this problem.
3. Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I needed 
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the 
business questions and produce the results needed.
4. Data analysis - With our new dataset, I used my analytical expertise to 
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the 
insights.
5. And finally I used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make 
recommendations on next steps.
