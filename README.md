## Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
### Project Overview
---
The Retail store seeks to carry out the comprehensive analysis of its sales performance across a defined period to gain valuable insights into customer preferences, product sales and regional performances.

### Problem
---
In this project, I was tasked with;
1. Analyzing the sales performance of a retail store and
2. To explore sales data to uncover key insights such as:
   - Top-selling products
   - Regional performance, and
   - Monthly sales trends
   
### Process

So, how did I tackle this problem?
Well I approached it in 5 steps:
1. Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand 
the data in detail. So I took the time to understand the data model and 
domain of the business.

2. Data cleaning - after understanding the business, I then cleaned the 
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for 
this problem.
This was done using the following tools;
    - Microsoft Excel- through the use of conditional formatting to check for duplicates
    -  Microsoft Power BI- using the transform data page to check for null values and errors.

3. Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I needed 
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the 
business questions and produce the results needed.

4. Data analysis - With the new dataset, I used my analytical expertise to 
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the 
insights. The following tools were used;
      - Microsoft Excel- this was done through the use of Formula like IF function,Average,Sum and Pivot table
      - SQL Server - analysis was done with queries like;
          - Total Sales by Product
        
     ```
     select sum(quantity_sold) as TotalSales,Product from SALES_DATA
     group by Product
     order by  TotalSales desc
     ```
     - Microsoft Power BI - Through the use of DAX functions(calculated measure) and Conditional columns
     
7. And finally I used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make 
recommendations on next steps.
